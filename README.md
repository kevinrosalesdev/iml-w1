# Introduction to Machine Learning - Work 1

## Datasets

________

- [`Iris`](datasets/iris.arff) (just for tests)
- Mixed: [`Adult`](datasets/adult.arff) [Huge]
- Nominal: [`Kropt`](datasets/kropt.arff) [Huge]
- Numerical:[`Pen-based`](datasets/pen-based.arff) [Medium]

## Schedule

| Saturday afternoon                                 | Sunday                                                       |
| :------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - **Kevin**: Basic implementation of `kmeans.py` . | - **Andrea**:  Implementation of `b_kmeans.py` (*Bisecting K-Means*). |
|                                                    | - **Alba**: Implementation of `k_x.py` (*K-medians/K-means++/K-harmonic*). |

> Remember to use git branches in order to avoid conflicts in code please!!
>
> - Remember to use `kmeans.py` implementations in your `b_kmeans.py` and `k_x.py` implementation. 
>
> - Change the filename of `k_x.py` according to the algorithm selected.
>
> - Please, as your algorithms are just small variances of *K-means*, analyze and try to improve the preprocessing of the data and the results of `dbscan.py`. You will find information about its parameters in *Work1_IML_2020.docx*.
